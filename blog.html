                <h1>Seperation</h1>
                <p>It is important to separate layout and design (css) from the html because it will make the html file less congested.
                    Also if you were to put the css rules in another css file, those rules could be applied to multiple html files all at once instead of 
                    configuring css rules one by one to each html file.
